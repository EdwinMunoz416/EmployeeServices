# Employee Services
## Project Description

Create a web application that can store employee data into a database and makes it easily accessable to the employees to manage any company service. My application has services to view employee details, update employee deatils, create a new employee, delete an employee, find an employee, and well as reimbursment management. You can log in as either employee / manager to view different services within the company database.
